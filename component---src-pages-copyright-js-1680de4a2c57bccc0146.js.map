We strive to be transparent in our data collection efforts and\n            to provide you with the data that you need to make decisions about\n            our collection of data from you.

First, the iFunny website and\n            mobile applications are publicly accessible and searchable to users\n            and visitors around the world. This means that anything that you\n            post to the iFunny website and mobile applications may be viewable\n            by third parties.

Disclosure of Personal Data We only\n            share your personal data in limited circumstances. We may share or\n            disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction.\n            We may also share your data with certain third parties to aid us in\n            operating the iFunny website or mobile applications. For example, we\n            may share your personal data with third parties, such as analytics\n            providers, to utilize their software tools and measure the\n            effectiveness of our advertisements. We may also share personal\n            data, such as device IDs, with third party advertisers to help them\n            determine whether they should serve an ad to you. The data that we\n            share with these third parties does not include your email address,\n            name, phone number, or username, but it may include your\n            geographical location. We may also share your personal data with our\n            accountants, auditors, insurers, or attorneys where doing so is\n            necessary to protect the interests of iFunny or to comply with any\n            law or regulation. We may also share your personal data with\n            government or law enforcement agencies when we are required to\n            report our data processing activities, upon receipt of an exigent\n            circumstances request, upon receipt of a duly authorized subpoena or\n            court order, or where doing so is necessary to protect our users,\n            our employees, our contractors, third parties, or property. Finally,\n            we may share your personal data to a third party if we sell,\n            transfer, or merge any part of our business or assets. In the event\n            that we share your personal data in the sale, transfer, or merger of\n            any part of our business or assets, this Privacy Policy will\n            continue to apply to your personal data when transferred to the new\n            entity. Management, Protection, and Retention of Your Personal Data\n            If you have registered an account with us and are a citizen of the\n            European Union, we provide you with account settings that let you\n            modify, correct, or delete the personal data that you have provided\n            to us that is associated with your account. Whether you are located\n            in the European Union or elsewhere, to stop our collection and use\n            of your personal data, you need only to delete your account. If you\n            have not registered an account with us, we only collect technical\n            data from you. To stop our collection and use of your technical\n            data, you need only cease using the iFunny website and uninstall the\n            iFunny mobile applications. We may transfer your personal data to\n            countries outside of the European Union, which may not offer the\n            same level of protection. Many of our third-party service providers\n            are located within the United States and their processing of\n            personal data will involve a transfer of data outside of the\n            European Union. Whenever personal data is transferred outside of the\n            European Union, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of\n            security by transferring your personal data to countries that the\n            European Commission has approved as providing an adequate level of\n            protection, by using contracts approved by the European Commission,\n            or by using US-based providers that are a part of the EU-US Privacy\n            Shield. We also put data security measures into place to protect\n            your personal data. We allow access to your personal data only by\n            employees and service providers who have a need to know or access\n            your personal data on our instructions. We will notify you and any\n            regulatory body of any breach of your personal data or our security\n            measures if and when we are legally required to do so. We will only\n            retain your personal data for so long as necessary to fulfill the\n            purposes for which it is collected under this Privacy Policy or for\n            the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting\n            requirements. Right to Access Data If you are a EU citizen, you may\n            have a right to request access to your personal data for correction,\n            transfer, erasure, or restriction, or to object to its processing or\n            withdraw your consent. If you wish to exercise any of these rights,\n            please contact our Data Protection Officer as disclosed in this\n            Privacy Policy. You do not need to pay a fee to access your PII or\n            to exercise your rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if\n            your request is unreasonable or excessive. To confirm your request,\n            we may need to request specific information from you as a security\n            measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to an\n            unauthorized third party. We will attempt to respond to all\n            legitimate requests within thirty days. Third Party Links Our\n            services may include links to third party websites and applications.\n            By clicking on third party links, you may allow third parties to\n            collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party\n            links and you are advised their respective privacy policies.\n            Responding to Do Not Track Signals You can generally opt-out of\n            receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad\n            networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)\n            or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory\n            Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out\n            pages on the NAI website and DAA website. Our websites are not\n            currently set up to respond to browser do-not-track signals, but you\n            can configure your browser settings to reject all cookies or prompt\n            you before a cookie is set. California Privacy Rights California\n            residents have a right to request that we disclose what personal\n            information we collect from you and whether, and how, we disclose or\n            sell that personal information.
